# Deep-Learning-Project-1
A simple 5 layer deep neural network using Python and TensorFlow

Homework 2 
 
1. (50 pts) Setup Python and Tensorflow and implement a deep neural network with 5 
layers. Use the first three column of the provided data to predict the third column label.  
Randomly select 90% of the data for training and test on the rest 10% of the data. You 
can use any Python and Tensorflow library.  
 
Your submission should include  
- neural network training source code (30 pts) 
- a test script that can load the trained neural network and run it on the test dataset (10 
pts) 
- a figure of validation loss for each epoch and test loss for each epoch (10 pts) 
 
2. (50 pts)  
- Provide results with and without normalization (standard scaling) (10 pts) 
- Provide results with two different mini-batch sizes (5 pts) 
- Provide results with two different learning rates (5 pts) 
- Provide results with Momentum and Adam optimizer (5 pts) 
- Provide results with two different initialization approaches: random and Xavier (10 pts) 
- Provide results with and without regularization (5 pts) 
Provide the code with all the options (commenting out one option) 
Provide all results as figures
